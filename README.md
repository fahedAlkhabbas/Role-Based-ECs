# Role-Based-ECs

This page comprises the code of the prototype developed to validate the feasability of our research paper titled "An Agent-based Approach to Realize Emergent Configurations in the Internet of Things"
We provide the Java source code in a folder called Role-based-ECs.zip. We also provide the dependencies needed to compile and run the project. The Jar files in the
dependencies.zip folder should be imported to the project. For example, in Intelliji, this can be done by applying the steps presented in this link (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051640/correct-way-to-add-external-jars-lib-jar-to-an-intellij-idea-project)

Our main contribution can be found in the ec package in the Role-based-ECs Java project. The project also comprises 5 experiments that can be found under the experiments
package. 


The source code of the Machine Learning model and service that forecast temperature can be downloaded via this link (https://www.dropbox.com/s/mvt9qy44a1pwbb2/ML%20project.zip?dl=0) 
It has not been added to Github due to its size.
